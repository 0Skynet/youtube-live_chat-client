####What is this ?
It's a small python script which allows you to extract the chat from Youtube live streams. 
It does not work with Youtube Gaming, but you can always get a "working url" by using the channel name. 
As long as the url is in this format: https://www.youtube.com/user/{username}/live it should work.

It's not meant to be a finished program, it is only a help for people who want to build something with the Youtube live stream chat. (Like all these twitch plugins/bots/etc.) And since there is no API for that at the moment...

If someone should be interested in more details or maybe needs a more advanced program, contact me ( o0Sky.Net0@gmail.com ), i will try to reply asap.
