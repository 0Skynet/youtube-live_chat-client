####What is this ?
It's a small python script which allows you to extract the chat from Youtube live streams. 
It does not work with Youtube Gaming, but you can always get a "working url" by using the channel name. 
As long as the url is in this format: https://www.youtube.com/user/{username}/live it should work.

It's not meant to be a finished program, it is only a help for people who want to build something with the Youtube live stream chat. (Like all these twitch plugins/bots/etc.) And since there is no API for that at the moment...

####How to use it ?
**You need:**
- Python 2.7
- Firefox

**And these libs:**
- BeautifulSoup4
- Selenium

I recommend installing these with "pip". (Google "python pip" if you have no idea what this is)

#####Contact

*Yes, I know this is a pretty "hacky" solution, but it is more meant to be an idea on how you could possibly solve the problem.*
